        <h3>Model Abstract</h3>
        A spread of a disease caused by a virus can happen through human to human contact or could be from the
        environment. A mathematical model could be used to capture the dynamics of the disease spread to estimate the
        infections, recoveries, and deaths that may result from the disease. An estimation is crucial to make policy
        decisions and for the alerts for the medical emergencies that may arise. Many epidemiological models are being
        used to make such an estimation. One major factor that is important in the predictions using the models is the
        dynamic nature of the disease spread. Unless we can come up with a way of estimating the parameters that guide
        this dynamic spread, the models may not give accurate predictions. Our dynamic model forecasts COVID-19 cases 7
        days hence, at the district level.

        The model is evaluated using the data taken from <a href="https://github.com/covid19india/api">COVID-19 India
            tracker API</a> at covid19india/API: Our Database, a
        crowd-sourced platform for India.

        When there is a sudden surge or downfall, the model takes at most 6 days to stabilize.
